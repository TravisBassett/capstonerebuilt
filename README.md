# capstone-bootstrap-vue

Project Purpose

This project is meant to provide the user with an easy way to search for any movie available in the IMDB database and get a variety of informaiton about it, including release year, director, rating, a poster image, and more.


Project Development

This project was developed using Bootstrap-Vue (https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/). Bootstrap-Vue is a powerful platform that allows develops to utilize features of Bootstrap while developing on the Vue.js framework. Because Bootstrap-Vue was used to develope this site, you may notice some prominent Bootstrap elements on in, including rows/columns and the jumbotrons. The ubiqutious rounded corners and some color schemes are also from Bootstrap, and where possible replicated with CSS for non-Bootstrap elements. This site (or app) also uses Axios to make an API call to OMDB (https://www.omdbapi.com/), a free API that allows developers to access informatino from IMDB, provides developers with links to movie posters for use of their sites. Visual Studio Code was the development environments. 


Deployment

This site is hosted on Github pages. For deployment it is necessary to download the source files, ensure that your development environment is running NPM, Vue.JS, and Bootstrap-Vue, and to run 'npm run build.' Because this site is hosted on Github pages additional configuration was required to deploy to a docs directory for that purpose.
